_Faster, Safer, Easier TEE Development._

DevKit is a tooling package built to accelerate development, improve code quality, and ensure
consistency across Private Compute Infrastructure Toolkit projects utilizing
[Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment).
faster, safer, and easier.

## Required

-   Sudo-less [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
-   [Docker Buildx plugin](https://github.com/docker/buildx)
-   [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases) (optional, if you want to build code
    outside of DevKit)

## Setup

> [!CAUTION] Take care to back up your files if you have _executed the bootstrap command before_.
> Files that have been generated from previous bootstraps will be overwritten.

1. Add DevKit as a submodule to your new or existing git repository. Replace `release-<version>`
   with the version you require from the available
   [branch releases](https://github.com/private-compute-infra-toolkit/devkit/branches/all?query=release-).

    ```sh
    git submodule add --name=devkit --branch=release-<version> https://github.com/private-compute-infra-toolkit/devkit.git .devkit
    ```

1. Add a linux symlink to the DevKit entrypoint scripts.

    ```sh
    ln -s .devkit/devkit devkit
    ```

1. Bootstrap the project.

    For the full list of supported templates and toolchains, navigate
    [here](https://github.com/private-compute-infra-toolkit/devkit/blob/main/templates.txt).

    ```sh
    devkit/bootstrap --template cpp --args toolchain=llvm_custom_sysroot
    ```

1. Build and spin up containerized build environment to start developing. To start other variants,
   use the corresponding `devkit/build-<variant>` script. Supported variants include `debian` and
   `rockylinux`.

    ```sh
    devkit/build bazel build //...
    ```

    Begin development by spinning up a container-based local development environment from the root
    of your project.

    ```sh
    devkit/dev
    devkit/vscode_ide --server # Spins up VS Code IDE in a local server at localhost:8080
    ```

## Configuration

The project configuration is stored in `devkit.json`. See [docs/devkit_json.md](docs/devkit_json.md)
for details.
