# build

The `build` script is your main gateway into the DevKit build environment. Its
primary purpose is to provide a consistent environment for all build and
test-related tasks. By running builds inside a container, you eliminate the
"works on my machine" problem.

This environment is packed with all the essential tools required for a robust
build process, primarily the Bazel (via Bazelisk). Bazel is responsible for
guaranteeing build hermeticity and reproducibility.

You can use the script in two main ways:

1. **Execute a command:** Pass any command and its arguments to the script, and
   it will be executed inside the container. For example:
   `build bazel build //...`

2. **Interactive session:** If you run the script with no arguments through
   `build`, it will drop you into an interactive `bash` shell inside the
   container, allowing you to explore the environment and run commands manually.

## Usage

```
{% include 'help/build.txt' %}
```

## Example

```sh
devkit/build bazel build //...
```
