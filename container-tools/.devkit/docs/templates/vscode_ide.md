# vscode_ide

The `vscode_ide` script launches a fully containerized Visual Studio Code
development environment. This provides a consistent and reproducible IDE setup,
complete with all necessary tools and extensions, regardless of your local
machine's configuration.

The script ensures that your settings, extensions, and other VS Code
configurations are persisted across sessions by mounting configuration
directories from your home directory (like `~/.config/Code` and `~/.vscode`)
into the container.

It supports two modes of operation:

1.  **Desktop Mode (default):** This launches a graphical VS Code window on your
    local desktop by integrating with your system's X11 server. It's ideal for a
    traditional desktop experience.
2.  **Server Mode (`--server`):** This runs VS Code as a web server inside the
    container, which you can access from your local web browser. This is perfect
    for remote development or running the IDE on a headless machine.

## Usage

```
{% include 'help/vscode_ide.txt' %}
```

## Example

```sh
devkit/vscode_ide --server
```
