# bep

The `bep` tool is a powerful utility for analyzing Bazel builds. It generates
detailed reports in the Build Event Protocol (BEP) format, which provides a
structured stream of events about a build's execution. This data is invaluable
for debugging build failures, analyzing dependency graphs, and understanding
build performance.

The tool operates by running the `bazel fetch` or `bazel build` command for
specified targets within the containerized `build-env`. The output is a
collection of JSON files, one for each target, which can be consumed by other
analysis and visualization tools.

If no specific targets are provided, the tool will analyze all targets within
the workspace (`//...`).

## Usage

```
{% include 'help/bep.txt' %}
```

## Example

```sh
devkit/bep --target BUILD --command fetch --output_dir bep_report/
```
