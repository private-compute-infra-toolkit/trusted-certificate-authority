# bootstrap

The `bootstrap` script is used to create new projects from a set of predefined
templates. It's the perfect starting point for a new service, library, or other
component, as it ensures that all the necessary boilerplate and configuration
are set up correctly from the beginning.

This tool uses the Jinja2 templating engine, processing a directory tree of
template files. You can pass in a context of key-value pairs as arguments,
allowing for flexible and dynamic project generation.

The entire process runs within the `tool-env` container, guaranteeing a
consistent and reliable bootstrapping experience regardless of your local
machine's setup.

## Usage

```
{% include 'help/bootstrap.txt' %}
```

## Example

```sh
devkit/bootstrap --template cpp --args toolchain=llvm_bootstrapped
```
